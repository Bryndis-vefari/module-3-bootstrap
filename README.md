#Understanding Bootstrap

As a complete beginner to Bootsrap, I thought it would be a good idea to type up the code to an already made Bootstrap website. I found a good video on youtube by Traversy Media: [Bootstrap 5 Crash Course - Website Build & Deploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s&t=213s) that takes you step by step through each section of a simple site. The guy was clear and explained what he was doing and why as he typed up the code. As I copied him, I started getting familiar with the main classes and he also showed how you can copy and paste snippets and search for specific things on the Bootstrap site. I also learned about [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) which is an open source illustration site, where you can grap illustrations for you projects. I think this was a good first step in using Bootstrap to build site, and I now understand what it is, how it works and I would now be able to build a simple site using Bootstrap 5.
